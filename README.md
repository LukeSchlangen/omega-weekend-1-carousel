Weekend Challenge 01
===

You'll be creating a "carousel" that will allow the user to move through an array of objects.

Tech:JQuery, Javascript
---

Base Mode:
===

Enclosed is a Javascript file that has an array of Objects. Each one of you is represented as an object within this array.

One person at a time should be shown on the DOM represented by showing their name and their shout out. Include "Prev" and "Next" buttons, that when pressed, show the information for the next or previous person, respectively. These should wrap - "prev" when on the first person should wrap around to show the last person and vice versa. 

Also on the DOM should be a display showing the number of people and which is being currently viewed (eg. "2/20")

When a person is displayed, show their name (first & last) and their shout out. Only one person should be shown at any given time.

Example:

Hard Mode:

Include a fade out and fade in animation in-between transitioning people.

Pro Mode:
===
Include a timer that moves to the next person if the user is not clicking on next or prev. If the user clicks on next or prev, the timer should be reset. The timer should transition between people every 10 seconds.
